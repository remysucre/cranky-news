Ms. Limón is the author of seven books of poetry and served three years as poet laureate. She spoke with the Monitor just before the publication of her latest book, “Startlement: New and Selected Poems.” The interview has been edited for length and clarity."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Poetry allows you to question things, but that questioning also leads to sometimes more questions but oftentimes a place of truth, a place of a deeper knowledge. It can be as simple as questioning whether or not you are loved, and questioning it deeply enough to find the answer that you were and that you are, in many ways, and you are held by the world. I think that those questions, the more they unravel, the more that they loosen us, allow us to see some of the undeniable truths of our world, which is that we are all connected on this planet for this short, brief moment together."

      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "It’s not just accepting the discomfort, but recognizing that questioning is actually our natural state, that it’s like breath, that we don’t need to be told to be breathing. We breathe, we live. And yet sometimes we need to focus on it. If you really think about your natural state as a human being in a body, it is a curious state. It’s that we look deeply at something, and we wonder about a plant or an animal that we see, or we wonder about a problem in front of us. Curiosity is our natural state and certainty and hardness and righteousness is actually not our natural state."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "[Around the country] the overwhelming feeling that I’m getting from the communities that I’ve been able to receive and witness from is anxiety. People are really scared. They’re anxious. They’re fearful. It’s a really hard place to live in. One of the nice things about being a poet is that we work in a mode that allows us to slow down and to be present and to breathe. And we naturally give ourselves tools to work through anxiety. I think poetry can be one of the many tools to help combat that anxiousness."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "In many ways every poem is dangerous because it is proving again and again that you are deeply, deeply human and that you have a soul. And I think that the more we make things, and the more we gather to celebrate that making – whether it’s going to someone’s reading, whether it’s an open mic, we need to show up for each other in a way that honors our humanity. We can get overwhelmed by the state of the world, not just nationally, but globally. And I think that there’s something to be said for just taking small action in celebrating the art that’s being made in your community, or that’s coming to your community."

    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "In many ways, it was to honor not just the past work, but the work that was done through the laureateship. I wanted the whole book to feel like one long poem. It was also quite emotional, because probably the earliest poem in the collection was written in my very early 20s. To go from 22 or 23 to 49 and to think of all the work that’s been made, you start to think of who you are. You really start to go back to the idea of curiosity and questions. What are the questions that I have kept returning to over and over again? What are the new realizations that have come to me and grown with me? What are the places and ancestors that are core to my writing life? What are the anchors that hold me?"

    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "For me, it really is a time to think about what it is to be human and what that means as we move forward for the next 100 years. Poets often are very good at the myopic and being present, deeply looking, paying attention. But I think we’re also good at the long view, expanding outward, thinking about the planet itself, thinking about what happens when neither you nor I are here. So I think that it’s about witnessing, paying attention, and being curious about who we are as individuals and as a collective. It’s both pensive and it’s complex. Because there’s so many minutes to a day, and there’s so many thoughts in a minute, and I’m really lucky that poetry is a place to hold all of it. That’s really important to me, that I have some place to hold it. Because I think all of us right now need to be held."
