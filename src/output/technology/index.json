Brands such as Roborock, Shark, iRobot, Eufy and Dyson are offering up to 60 % off flagship models, bringing premium features like self-emptying docks and laser dirt detection to far lower price points. The early deals signal both fierce competition in the smart-cleaning market and a timely opportunity for shoppers to automate household chores for less."

The list points to successive waves of Macs powered by new M5 and M6 chips—spanning MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, iMac, Mac mini, Mac Studio and Mac Pro—suggesting Apple plans yearly performance bumps and even a yet-unnamed Mac. The disclosure offers an unusually detailed glimpse into Apple’s silicon strategy and reassures users and developers that the Apple-silicon transition continues at full speed."

Because the pages are hosted on Vercel’s own infrastructure, they inherit valid HTTPS certificates and URLs that look credible, sharply increasing the risk of credential theft and forcing defenders to rethink traditional “spot the fake” training."

While the total missed Wall Street’s consensus by about 10,000 units, it still topped several bearish forecasts and provides a clearer picture of slowing global demand for electric vehicles. The numbers arrive as CEO Elon Musk juggles side projects and political skirmishes, prompting analysts to question whether distractions are hurting Tesla’s core car business."

The package preserves Trump-era tax cuts but trims or eliminates federal incentives for solar, wind, electric vehicles, and some energy-efficiency upgrades, while also extending new deductions and reallocating spectrum to major wireless carriers. Technology firms avoided a proposed federal pre-emption on state AI regulations, yet analysts warn that reduced clean-energy support and tighter power supplies could hinder growth of data centers and the broader U.S. AI industry."

Together, the leaks signal Samsung’s push to match — and potentially eclipse — rival Chinese foldables on portability and polish."

The trial is limited and users who ignore an initial ping will not receive additional nudges, according to internal guidelines."

While humans are now being hired to clean up these glitches, companies are simultaneously pushing ahead with more advanced AI, from million-strong warehouse robots at Amazon to hospital assistants planned by Foxconn and Kawasaki, underscoring a fast-moving—and occasionally messy—transition period."
