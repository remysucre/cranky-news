Researchers describe how these microbial communities intercept methane at cold seeps, while noting both the promise and practical hurdles of turning them into a climate tool. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, so any safe way to curb releases would be meaningful for warming."

The geoarchaeological work also indicates the site rose as a sacred island amid Nile floods and may have been placed to echo a creation myth of first land emerging from primeval waters. Together, the findings trace Karnak’s environmental and cultural transformation across roughly 3,000 years."

A climate risk expert warned insured costs are likely to continue rising."

The research challenges the long-held idea that a rudder problem sealed the ship’s fate, instead pointing to broader structural deficiencies and a design not suited to compressive pack ice loads that ultimately crushed the vessel in 1915. The work, published in Polar Record and informed by insights from the 2022 Endurance22 wreck discovery, reframes how and why the famed ship sank."

In a cheerful twist, Ramsdell initially missed the news because he was hiking off the grid and learned of the prize hours later."
