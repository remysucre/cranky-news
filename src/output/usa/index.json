Despite $45 billion in new funding under President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act to nearly triple detention capacity to more than 100,000 beds, reporting says ICE has added little capacity in three months as arrests fell from a June peak. Overcrowding has worsened in short-term holding cells, and a New York City judge ordered immediate improvements at the Lower Manhattan processing center—an accountability step aimed at better conditions."

After President Trump moved to send federalized California and Texas Guard units, the judge expanded her order to bar relocating, federalizing, or deploying any state's Guard in Oregon, noting there was no evidence Portland required federal military intervention. The Justice Department is appealing the ruling."
