Analysts say Aso and Suzuki could temper large fiscal spending plans, even as stocks rose and the yen fell on expectations of stimulus and a slower pace of rate hikes. Her path remains politically tricky: the LDP needs coalition support to command a majority in parliament, and she still must secure enough votes in the Diet to take office."

The appointment was presented as a bid to defuse unrest over his rule."

Recent negotiations under a U.S.-backed plan put forward by President Trump in Cairo aim to exchange prisoners, enable a phased Israeli withdrawal and end the war—raising hopes of returning hostages and halting the fighting."

Macron signaled he could call snap legislative elections if negotiations fail, against the backdrop of a hung parliament since mid-2024 snap polls."
